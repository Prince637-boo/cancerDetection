**Learn to build three machine learning models (Logic Regression, Decision tree, Random forest) from scratch**


*Here you will learn to build three models that are Logistic regression model, the Decision Tree model, and Random Forest Classifier model using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either Malignant or Benign.*

We will use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from Kaggle.

**Prerequisite**

*You should be familiar with the Python Programming language and you should have a theoretical understanding of the three algorithms that is Logistic regression model, Decision Tree model, and Random Forest Classifier model.*
